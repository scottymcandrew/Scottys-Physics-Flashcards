Who discovered Titan and when?::Christiaan Huygens in 1655 using a telescope he built with his brother Constantijn.
What is Titan's position in terms of size among moons in our Solar System?::It's the second largest moon in the Solar System, slightly smaller than Jupiter's moon Ganymede but larger than the planet Mercury.
What is the mean density of Titan?::1.88 × 10^3 kg m^-3, indicating it's made of a combination of ice and rock rather than being predominantly rocky.
What is the surface temperature of Titan?::93.65 ± 0.50 K (about -180°C), cold enough for methane to exist as a liquid.
What is the surface pressure on Titan?::1.467 ± 0.001 bar, which is about 1.5 times Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level.
What are the main constituents of Titan's atmosphere?::Nitrogen (N₂, ~95%), methane (CH₄, ~5%), hydrogen (H₂), and trace amounts of other hydrocarbons and nitriles.
Why is Titan unique among moons in the Solar System?::It's the only moon with a dense atmosphere and the only place besides Earth with stable bodies of surface liquid.
How is Titan's rotation related to its orbit?::Like most planetary moons, Titan has synchronous rotation (tidal locking), meaning the same face is always turned toward Saturn.
Which spacecraft first flew by Titan?::Pioneer 11 in 1979, but it obtained relatively little data from a distance of 363,000 km.
Which spacecraft provided the first detailed information about Titan?::Voyager 1 in 1980, flying by at a distance of 4,394 km.
What was the name of the mission that included a probe landing on Titan's surface?::The Cassini-Huygens mission, a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Italian Space Agency (ASI).
When did the Huygens Probe land on Titan's surface?::January 14, 2005.
What does Titan look like to the human eye?::An orange-hazy world with an opaque atmosphere hiding the surface completely - like a featureless orange ball.
If you could travel to Titan without a spacesuit (ignoring the extreme cold), how would the atmosphere feel compared to Earth?::Slightly denser than Earth's atmosphere - like being about 5 meters underwater on Earth, but without the crushing pressure.
Why is the surface of Titan not visible in visible light images?::The thick haze layer in Titan's atmosphere, composed of organic particles, scatters and blocks visible light from reaching and returning from the surface.
How can we see through Titan's haze to observe its surface?::By using infrared imaging, radar, and other wavelengths where the atmosphere is transparent - similar to how infrared goggles can help you see through fog on Earth.
What was the main instrument on Cassini that allowed scientists to see Titan's surface features?::The radar instrument, which could penetrate the atmosphere and provide images of the surface at 350 m to 1.7 km spatial resolution.
What did the Voyager missions reveal about Titan's atmosphere?::They revealed that the atmosphere is primarily nitrogen (N₂) with many organic molecules like methane (CH₄), ethane (C₂H₆), propane (C₃H₈), and others, but couldn't see the surface.
What is a haze or photochemical smog on Titan?::A layer of tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere that results from chemical reactions involving sunlight (photochemistry) breaking down methane and nitrogen molecules, which recombine to form more complex organic compounds.
How does photodissociation work in Titan's atmosphere?::Solar UV radiation provides energy to break chemical bonds in methane and nitrogen molecules, creating reactive fragments that recombine to form more complex organic molecules - like breaking LEGO pieces apart to build new structures.
Write the chemical equation for the photodissociation of methane in Titan's atmosphere::CH₄ + photon → CH₂ + H₂ or CH₄ + photon → CH₃ + H
What happens to methane in Titan's upper atmosphere?::It undergoes photodissociation by UV light, breaking into fragments that recombine to form more complex hydrocarbons like ethane (C₂H₆), ethene (C₂H₄), ethyne (C₂H₂), and eventually more complex chain molecules.
How does Titan's atmospheric chemistry compare to Earth's?::Both have nitrogen as the main constituent, but Titan's atmosphere is rich in hydrocarbons with no free oxygen, while Earth's has oxygen and very little hydrocarbon content in the atmosphere.
What is a radical in atmospheric chemistry?::A molecule with an unpaired electron that makes it highly reactive, commonly produced in photochemical reactions when bonds are broken - like a person with one free hand eagerly looking to grab onto something!
How do you calculate column mass of an atmosphere?::Column mass (Mc) = Pressure (P) / surface gravity (g). For Titan, this equals approximately 1.09 × 10^5 kg m^-2, about 10 times Earth's atmospheric column mass.
What is the temperature profile of Titan's atmosphere?::It has a troposphere (temperature decreases with height), stratosphere (temperature increases with height), mesosphere (temperature decreases again), and thermosphere (temperature increases with height at the top).
Why does Titan have a stratosphere?::The absorption of UV radiation by methane in the upper atmosphere creates heating, causing temperature to increase with altitude in that region - similar to how ozone creates Earth's stratosphere.
How does methane cycle on Titan?::Methane evaporates from surface lakes, rises in the atmosphere, forms clouds, rains back to the surface, and flows through river channels to lakes - similar to Earth's water cycle but with methane instead of water.
Why is the continued presence of methane in Titan's atmosphere puzzling?::Methane is constantly being destroyed by photochemistry and should be depleted within tens of millions of years, suggesting there must be a replenishment source.
What evidence is there for methane rain on Titan?::Dendritic (branching) river channels flowing into lower areas, darkening of surface regions after cloud clearings, and rounded pebbles at the Huygens landing site suggesting fluid erosion.
What is the composition of Titan's lakes and seas?::Primarily liquid methane and ethane, with dissolved nitrogen and other hydrocarbons - the ethane predominantly coming from atmospheric methane that was processed through photochemistry.
Where are most of Titan's lakes and seas located?::Primarily at the high latitudes, especially near the north pole (including the largest seas Kraken Mare and Ligeia Mare).
What feature was first observed in 2009 that provided definitive proof of liquid on Titan's surface?::Sunglint - the mirror-like reflection of sunlight from the surface of one of Titan's seas, which could only come from a liquid surface.
What are the "cat scratches" features observed in Titan's equatorial regions?::Vast dune fields made of solid hydrocarbon particles (similar to Earth's sand dunes but made of frozen organic material) that can reach heights of up to 100 meters and stretch for hundreds of kilometers.
What evidence suggests Titan has a subsurface ocean?::Titan's surface rotates about 0.36° per year faster than expected for a solid body (due to atmospheric drag), and Titan has larger tidal distortion (about 10 meters) than would be possible if it were solid throughout - both suggesting a liquid layer decoupling the surface from the interior.
What is the current model of Titan's interior structure?::A 50 km outer ice shell, floating on a subsurface ocean up to 250 km deep, with another ice layer below, and a weakly differentiated ice/rock mixture extending to the center.
How does Titan's interior differ from that of Europa or Enceladus?::Titan appears to be less completely differentiated, meaning its material hasn't fully separated by density, similar to Callisto rather than the more completely differentiated moons like Europa.
What is serpentinization and how might it relate to Titan?::A process where water reacts with rock to produce methane, which could have occurred within Titan's interior early in its history and contributed to its methane inventory. This is also proposed for Mars and some other icy moons.
What evidence suggests that Titan's methane might come from its interior?::The detection of argon-40 (⁴⁰Ar) in Titan's atmosphere, which is produced by radioactive decay in the rocky interior, proves that gas exchange between the deep interior and the atmosphere has occurred.
What are cryovolcanoes and why are they important for Titan?::Volcanoes that erupt substances that would be solid at normal temperatures (like water, ammonia, and methane) which could provide the mechanism for releasing methane from Titan's interior to replenish the atmosphere.
How do the organic processes on Titan relate to early Earth?::Titan's atmosphere serves as a natural laboratory for organic chemistry similar to what might have occurred on early Earth before life arose, creating complex organic molecules from simpler compounds.
