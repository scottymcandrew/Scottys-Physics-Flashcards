Describe a widely accepted definition of life.	A NASA discussion panel proposed the definition: ‘a self-sustaining chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution’ [1]. Most biologists identify two key features that indicate life: the capacity for self-replication and the capacity to undergo Darwinian evolution [2].
List the primary elements that form the basis of organic compounds in living organisms.	The primary elements are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen [3]. Commonly, organic compounds also contain sulfur and phosphorus [3, 4].
Name some metals that bond with carbon in organic compounds found in living organisms.	Iron, magnesium, and zinc are some metals that bond with carbon [4].
What is the most abundant molecule in living tissues?	Water is the major component of living tissues, generally accounting for 70% of their mass [3].
Identify the four main types of macromolecules found in living systems.	The four main types are lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids [5].
Where in the cosmos is organic matter known to be created abiotically?	Organic matter is created in the circumstellar envelopes around carbon-rich red giant stars [6], in molecular clouds (cold and dense parts of the interstellar medium) [7, 8], and in solar nebulae (spinning discs of dust and gas during star formation) [9]. Organic compounds are also found in meteorites [10, 11] and comets [12].
Explain one way organic matter could have been delivered to the early Earth.	Extraterrestrial objects such as meteorites and comets could have delivered organic matter to the early Earth through impacts [13, 14].
Describe the Miller-Urey experiment and its significance to the origin of life.	The Miller-Urey experiment simulated early Earth conditions by circulating water vapor through a flask containing methane, ammonia, and hydrogen, subjected to electrical discharges. It produced amino acids abiotically, suggesting that the basic organic building blocks of life could form relatively simply in a reducing atmosphere [11, 15].
What is a potential challenge to the idea that life's organic building blocks were formed in situ on the early Earth?	Recent models suggest the early Earth's atmosphere was not as methane- and ammonia-rich (reducing) as previously thought, potentially making Miller-Urey synthesis much more difficult. The more stable molecules like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water may have dominated [16].
Explain how polymerization could have contributed to chemical complexity on the early Earth.	Polymerization, the process where small organic molecules (monomers) combine to form large molecules (polymers) with the loss of water, could have generated the macromolecules (lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids) necessary for life [17-22].
Name three possible concentration mechanisms for organic molecules on the early Earth.	Marginal marine environments (lagoons, tidal pools), freezing aqueous solutions, and the surfaces of clays and other minerals are possible concentration mechanisms [23].
Describe the formation of micelles and their potential relevance to the origin of life.	Amphiphilic molecules in water tend to form small spherical structures called micelles, with hydrophilic heads facing the water and hydrophobic tails tucked inside. These structures could have provided the original membrane-bounded environment required for cellular life to begin [24, 25].
What are coacervates and how might they have contributed to prebiotic chemistry?	Coacervates are droplets formed by the grouping of polymers like proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides in water. They can preferentially incorporate other substances, potentially serving as prebiotic chemical factories [26].
Describe proteinoid microspheres and a life-like property they exhibited.	Proteinoid microspheres are small spheres with a double wall resembling a biological membrane, formed by dissolving cooled proteinoids (amino acid polymers created by heating) in hot water and allowing the solution to cool. They could shrink or swell depending on salt concentration and even produce buds that separated to form second-generation microspheres [27, 28].
List four key roles that minerals could have played in the origin of life.	Protection, support, selection, and catalysis [29].
What is the significance of ribozymes in the context of the RNA world hypothesis?	Ribozymes are RNA molecules with catalytic properties similar to enzymes. The fact that RNA can both store genetic information and act as a catalyst suggests a simpler ‘RNA world’ may have preceded the current ‘DNA-plus-protein world’, making proteins unnecessary for simple life initially [30, 31].
Define chirality and explain its relevance to biological molecules.	Chirality is a property where a molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image, existing in left-handed (L) and right-handed (D) forms [32-35]. Life on Earth uses only left-handed amino acids in proteins, and the presence of an excess of left-handed amino acids in meteorites suggests a possible extraterrestrial origin for this preference [36, 37].
What is one proposed mechanism for the generation of an excess of left-handed amino acids in extraterrestrial environments?	Ultraviolet circularly polarized light (UVCPL) emitted by star-forming regions can preferentially destroy one form of a chiral molecule over the other, potentially leading to an excess of one handedness [38, 39].
Describe the role of molecular phylogeny in understanding the origin of life.	Molecular phylogeny, by examining genetic material like ribosomal RNA in different organisms and constructing phylogenetic trees, helps determine evolutionary relationships. The organisms closest to the root of the universal tree of life are often used to infer the characteristics of life's last common ancestor [40-42].
What type of organism is often found near the root of the universal phylogenetic tree, and what does this suggest about early life?	Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles (heat-loving microorganisms) are often found near the root, suggesting that the last common ancestor may have been a heat-loving organism, possibly living in environments like deep-sea hydrothermal vents [43-45].
